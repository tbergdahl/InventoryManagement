# Acme Inventory Management System
## Project summary
### One-sentence description of the project
Our project aims to help the Acme Corporation Food Bank's struggles with managing its inventory of food and hygiene donations, tracking item quantities, expiration dates, and maintaining detailed records for accurate reporting through the use of an inventory management system.
### Additional information about the project
The Acme Corporation Food Bank faces challenges in managing its inventory of food and hygiene donations due to the frequent and varied nature of the donations. Tracking items, their quantities, and expiration dates, along with maintaining detailed records for accurate reporting, is a critical need. Also, the organization requires an efficient way to generate reports from data collected from multiple entities. Currently, there is no comprehensive solution in place to manage these challenges effectively, creating inefficiencies and potential risks of inaccurate/incomplete data management.
