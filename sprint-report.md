## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't
repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand
how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any
significant learnings for your team.
## Unfinished Work
We need to develop a comprehensive system that includes a login page with user authentication to grant access to different pages based on user roles. The system will also feature an inventory management module where users can monitor product inflow and outflow. This will include an inventory display page that provides real-time updates on stock levels, as well as an account management section to oversee user credentials and access permissions. Additionally, the system will generate reports using visual representations like pie charts and bar charts to analyze inventory trends and performance. An inventory login page will also be implemented to ensure secure access to stock-related information.
