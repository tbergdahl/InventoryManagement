## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we completed building out the inventory and report generation pages. This is all completely new and some of the techincal barriers we overcame were fixing/rewriting the routes, laying out/styling things how we wanted them on the pages, and making the app feel consistent or having a good UX. And we also did the two factor authentication using email method. 
## Unfinished Work
Integrating the MFA for the login/signup page
